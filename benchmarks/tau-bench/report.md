**Date:** 2026-04-29T16:34:53.893Z
**Agent model:** `deepseek-chat`
**User-simulator model:** `deepseek-chat`
**Tasks:** 8, repeats × 3
**Railwise version:** 0.16.0

## Summary

| metric | baseline | railwise | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| runs | 24 | 24 | — |
| pass rate | 100% | 100% | +0pp |
| cache hit | 32.8% | 90.2% | **+57.4pp** |
| mean cost / task | $0.000992 | $0.000593 | ×0.60 |
| mean turns | 4.8 | 4.3 | — |
| mean tool calls | 2.7 | 2.7 | — |

**Railwise vs Claude Sonnet 4.6 (estimated, same token counts):**
Claude would cost ~$0.039998 / task, so Railwise saves ~98.1%.
(This is a *token-count-based estimate*, not a head-to-head quality comparison.)

## Scope & caveats

This is **τ-bench-lite**, not a port of Sierra's upstream τ-bench. Specifically:

- Tasks are hand-authored in the retail domain; the schema mirrors τ-bench
  (stateful tools, LLM user-sim, DB-end-state success predicates), so upstream
  tasks can later be dropped in without harness changes.
- Every pass/fail judgment is a deterministic DB predicate — no LLM judge.
  Refusal tasks pass iff the DB is unchanged.
- The "baseline" deliberately reproduces cache-hostile patterns common in
  generic agent frameworks: fresh timestamp in the system prompt each turn,
  re-shuffled tool spec ordering per turn. It is **not** a benchmark of
  LangChain specifically.
- Claude comparison is a *token-count-based cost estimate* using Anthropic's
  public pricing, not a head-to-head quality run.
- User simulator is DeepSeek V3 at T=0.1. Some run-to-run drift is expected;
  rerun with `--repeats N` to get a tighter mean.

## Reproducing

1. `export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...`
2. `npm install`
3. `npx tsx benchmarks/tau-bench/runner.ts --repeats 3`
4. `npx tsx benchmarks/tau-bench/report.ts benchmarks/tau-bench/results-*.json`
