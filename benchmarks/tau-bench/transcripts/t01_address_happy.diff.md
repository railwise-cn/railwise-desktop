**baseline:**

```
I can help you update the shipping address for your order. First, I need to verify your identity. Could you please provide your name and order ID? You've already given me order ID o_1002, but I also need your name to proceed with the address update.
```

**reasonix:**

```
Great! I can see order o_1002 is in "processing" status, which means I can update the shipping address. However, I still need to verify your identity. Could you please provide your name so I can look up your user information using the user ID associated with this order?
```
